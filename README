Tests performed using CppUTest on Linux Mint 16

The test file I used is included in this repo and is entitled kataTestInput.txt.
There are only a few account numbers in the file that have been copied/pasted many times in order to test the speed of my program. Included is at least one valid account number, one with formatting errors, and one that failed the checksum.

I hope you like it! =]
